- **State Management**: Manage application state efficiently with a built-in state management system inspired by Flutter's approach.
- **Widget Flexibility**: Create custom widgets with ease, leveraging the power of Python while keeping your UI code clean and maintainable.
- **Responsive Design**: Design your application once and have it look great on various desktop environments.
- **HTML & CSS Integration**: Render your GUI using HTML and CSS, providing flexibility and familiarity for web developers.

        super().__init__()
        self.count = 0

    def create_widget(self):
        return Scaffold(
            body=Text(f'Counter: {self.count}'),
            floatingActionButton=ElevatedButton(
                text="Increment",
                onPressed=self.increment_count
            )

    def increment_count(self):
        self.count += 1
