Next Steps

    State Management:
        Implement a simple state management system. This could include stateful widgets or a provider-like pattern to manage and propagate state changes across the app.

    Form Widgets:
        TextField Widget: Implement the TextField widget for text input, including validation options.
        Checkbox Widget: Implement the Checkbox widget with customizable labels and states.
        RadioButton Widget: Implement RadioButton widgets for selecting one option from a set.
        Switch Widget: Implement the Switch widget for toggling settings on and off.

    Alert Dialogs and Popups:
        AlertDialog Widget: Implement a modal dialog to display messages, with customizable buttons for user actions.
        PopupMenuButton Widget: Implement a button that shows a dropdown menu when pressed.

    Animations:
        Implement basic animations for transitions, such as fade in/out, slide, and scale animations.

    Navigation:
        Navigator: Implement a navigation system to manage the stack of pages and route transitions.
        PageRoute: Implement different types of page routes (e.g., slide transition, fade transition).

    Custom Widgets:
        Allow users to create their custom widgets by extending a base widget class.

    Responsive Layouts:
        Implement responsive layout handling to adjust the UI based on screen size (e.g., Grid layout adjustments, adaptive padding).

    Dialogs and Bottom Sheets:
        Enhance the BottomSheet with options like persistent and modal modes.
        Add support for custom dialogs and bottom sheets with user-defined content.

    Theming and Styles:
        Implement a theming system to manage light/dark themes and allow for global styling.

    Gesture Detection:
        Implement gesture detectors for detecting swipes, taps, long presses, etc.

    Performance Optimization:
        Implement lazy loading for ListView and GridView widgets to handle large datasets efficiently.
        Optimize rendering performance for complex layouts.

    Testing and Debugging Tools:
        Develop tools for testing widgets and debugging layout issues (e.g., widget inspector, performance overlay).
